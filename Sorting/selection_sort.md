Selection Sort: 

- Easy Implementation, O(n^2) Worst Case Time Complexity. 

- Algorithm: A] Take first element of array as curr_min. 

             B] Iterate thru array, find value lower than curr_min.

             C] If value found, then swap position. Found value should become curr_min, and original curr_min should be in found value index. 

             D] Iterate through whole array. 

             D] For second cycle, take curr_min as second element as array and repeat.
